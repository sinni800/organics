### Current ###
Currently the Organics APIs consist of two portions, both of which are dire in order to use Organics.
  * [JavaScript Client API](JSClientApi.md)
  * [Go Server API](GoServerApi.md)

### Future ###
In the future, an _Go client API_ may be provided (see [issue 1](https://github.com/sinni800/organics/issues/1)).
